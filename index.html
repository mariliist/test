            <h3>Storyline</h3>

            <p class="text">Peter Benjamin Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy and shy but intelligent high school senior
                student at Midtown Secondary College Of Science & Technology in Queens, New York City. His parents are
                dead and he lives with his Uncle Benjamin Franklin "Ben" Parker (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt Mayabella
                "May" Parker (Rosemary Harris). He has a crush on his next door neighbor, Mariam "Mary" Jane Watson
                (Kirsten Dunst), who is also one of the few classmates who is nice to him. Her boyfriend, a sports
                player and the school bully, Eugene "Flash" Thompson (Joe Manganiello) and his buddies bully and pick on
                him. Peter's only friend is Harold Theopolis "Harry" Osborn (James Franco), who, though rich and
                good-looking, is similarly an outcast.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his
                billionaire scientist father, Professer Norman Virgil Osborn (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the
                founder, owner and head of weapons contractor of Oscorp Science Industries, appreciates Peter's
                scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Peter's science class takes a field trip excursion to a genetics science laboratory at Columbia
                University. The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of "super-spiders"
                through genetic DNA manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the
                school newspaper, one of these new genetically-altered spiders (one which is red and blue) escapes
                without anyone noticing lands on his hand and hungrily bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and
                immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the genetically mutated DNA-filled venom injected by the
                spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits
                Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists,
                Professor Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all
                of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the gas formula. He
                gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp
                inventions, a green goblin-shaped armoured exoskeleton flight suit and bat-shaped jet glider.

            <h3>FILM REVIEW </h3>
            <h2>Muscles Ripple, Webs Unfurl, Hormones Race</h2>
            <p class="text"> THE first thing you see, after the house lights dim and before the credits begin, is a
                flurry of comic book panels accompanied by the Marvel logo. These inky, pulpy images are followed by
                the glossy, silvery letters of the title, and the contrast suggests that comic books and large-scale
                Hollywood blockbusters may not be as compatible as the movie studios would have us believe.
                Traditional comic books are cheap, stubbornly low-tech and sometimes slow moving.</p>
            <p class="text">For their part, the movies that lumber into the multiplexes every summer tend to be
                stratospherically expensive, loaded with the latest special effects and stuffed with ear-splitting
                and eye-straining action sequences designed to leave you glutted with sensation, if not always
                satisfied.</p>
            <p class="text">
                ''Spider-Man,'' which opens today nationwide, is, inevitably, all of these things, but the director,
                Sam Raimi, and the screenwriter, David Koepp, have not lost track of the deeper, simpler
                satisfactions of superhero worship, chief among which is identification. The original Spider-Man,
                created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics in 1962, was not, under the costume, an
                interplanetary exile like Superman or a reclusive millionaire like Batman, but an ordinary,
                disaffected urban adolescent. As he swooped through the skyscraper canyons of New York (not Gotham
                City or Metropolis), the web slinger spun self-mocking, self-pitying soliloquies that mirrored the
                thoughts of his likely readers. Referring to himself as ''your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,''
                he seemed aware of the absurdity inherent in being a freelance big-city crime fighter.
