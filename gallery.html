            <h3>Storyline</h3>

            <p class="text">Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy
                high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his
                stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson.<br> To say his life is "miserable" is an
                understatement.<br>
                But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his
                life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique, clear
                vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the
                fun isn't going to last. <br>An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance
                enhancing
                drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become
                Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face
                and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.
